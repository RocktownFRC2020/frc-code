Shooter method: raw percent

Works:
    Shooter
    Distance

Nervous:
    Drivetrain
    Gearbox

Untested:
    Target alignment
    Color wheel



Plan for tmrw:

1) Test drivetrain
2) Test gearbox
3) Test distance alignment
4) Test angle alignment
5) Ensure that we have a working robot
6) Ensure that we have a working robot
7) Ensure that we have a working robot
8) Experiment with PID
9) Autonomous
